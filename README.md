# cloner

the git clone tool
(VERY RUDIMENTARY)

a bash script written solely to clone repositories.

.
or maybe more?

Get Started
===========
There are many ways you set this up.
you could try to 

RUN THE INSTALLSCRIPT
-------------------------------
1. > cd cloner
2. > clonerinstall.sh

Now typing clone would trigger the Cloner Applet.

OR

MODIFY THE SCRIPT AND UPDATE INSTALL
------------------------------------
This is for users who want to customize their cloner applet.
feel free to edit the file as you wish and when you want to run it
type these commands into your terminal,

1. > cd cloner
2. > chmod 775 cloner.sh
3. > ./cloner.sh
4. > sudo cp -r cloner.sh cloner

Now run the Install Script if you haven't already
